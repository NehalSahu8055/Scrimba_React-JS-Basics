# Temperature Converter

This repository contains a solution to the Temperature Converter challenge, which is part of the [Code Alpha](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codealpha/) internship program.

## Challenge Details

This project is a simple web-based temperature converter. It allows users to enter a temperature value and select the unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and then it converts and displays the temperature in the other two units. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly tool for temperature conversion.
